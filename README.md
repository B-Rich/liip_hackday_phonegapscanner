Android Phonegap Barcode Scanner
================================

This barcode scanner relies on Phonegap [1] and the ZXing (Zebra Crossing) [2] barcode scanner implementation which is part of the Phonegap plugins [3]  
  
We evaluated several barcodescanners in form of a Hackday and figured out which is the best implementation for each platform (Android, iPhone) to use with Phonegap.
